# Hyperparameter Tuning on Telco Churn Dataset

This project compares three hyperparameter tuning techniques:
- Grid Search
- Random Search
- Bayesian Optimization (Optuna)

The analysis uses the Telco Customer Churn dataset and evaluates Random Forest models based on ROC AUC, confusion matrix, and training time.

## Features
- Full EDA and preprocessing
- Clean, reproducible Jupyter notebook
- ROC curve and confusion matrix comparison
- Accessibility features in visuals
- Inline explanations with markdown

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
2. Open the notebook: `Hyperparameter_Tuning_with_ROC_CM.ipynb`
3. Run all cells step by step.

## Dataset
